# Algebraic Graphs in Scala

This is only an experiment at this point. If you'd like this library to be
developed further, please raise an issue.

If you don't know what algebraic graphs are, have a look at
[this paper](https://github.com/snowleopard/alga-paper).

## Build

Build by running `sbt` and then `run`.
