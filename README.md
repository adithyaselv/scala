# Algebraic Graphs in Scala

This is only an experiment at this point. If you'd like this library to be
developed further, please raise an issue. There is only
[one file](https://github.com/algebraic-graphs/scala/blob/master/src/main/scala/alga/Graph.scala)of interest at the moment.

If you don't know what algebraic graphs are, have a look at
[this paper](https://github.com/snowleopard/alga-paper).

## Build

Build by running `sbt` and then `run`.

## Experiment in REPL

Run `:paste src/main/scala/alga/Graph.scala` in `scala` REPL.
