# Algebraic Graphs in Scala

There is only
[one file of interest](https://github.com/algebraic-graphs/scala/blob/master/src/main/scala/alga/Graph.scala)
at the moment.

This is only an experiment at this point. If you'd like this library to be developed further,
please raise an issue.

If you don't know what algebraic graphs are, have a look at
[this paper](https://github.com/snowleopard/alga-paper).

## Compile

Run `sbt` and then `compile`.

## Experiment in REPL

Run `:paste src/main/scala/alga/Graph.scala` in `scala` REPL.

## Build docs

Run `scaladoc src/main/scala/alga/Graph.scala`, browse `alga/Graph.html`.
